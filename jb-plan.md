Title : Neuro Data Science
============================

key words: data-science, teaching, python, statistical toolbox, reproducible science, 
computational toolbox 

Syllabus:
-----------

Neuroscientists rely increasingly on data accessible online and on data science
procedures for their investigations. Data science now offers a key set of
tools and methods to efficiently analyse, visualize and interpret neuroscience
data. Concurrently, there is a growing concern in the life sciences that many
results produced are difficult or even impossible to reproduce. This is
referred to as the reproducibility crisis, which concerns most of biomedical
fields [F. Collin]. 

This course is bringing together computational and analytical tools and methods.
It will teach students how to best use the fundamentals of data science in
their daily work to produce reproducible results. We will take examples in
neuroimaging or imaging genetics, and see how to use computational tools,
statistical and machine learning techniques, and collaborative and open science
methodology to generate results that are statistically solid and
computationally reproducible. While a large part of this course is language
agnostic, we will teach and use python throughout the course and work on small
projects. 

The course will require that you have some basic programming experience and some
notion of statistical analysis, but will be aimed at life scientists
(neurologists, psychiatrists, pyschologists, neuroscientists) who wish to
improve their research practices, or students who want an introduction to
data science with examples in neuroscience and neuroimaging. We will strive to avoid
the classic problem described in Figure 1.
